# checklist

A collection of checklists, performing various tasks in the c language.<br><br>

check1: synchronised handles in windows<br>
check2: multidimensional pointer reference<br>
check3: arithemtic using inline assembly with input and output to var<br>
check4: comparing addresses of the parameter with variables defined within the scope of foxtrot<br>
check5: comparing negation by means of two's complement, insofar as the sign-bit of a signed four byte integer is 2^31<br>
check6: defining a pointer as a static array<br>
check7: redefining a variable with reference to a pointer in the scope of foxtrot<br>
check8: selection sort<br>
check9: defining a void pointer using addresses of a string as well as returning values from foxtrot using void pointers as parameters<br>
check10: right shifting with arithmetic using static values<br>
check11: right shifting with arithmetic in the scope of a function using dynamic values<br>
check12: converting string characters to upper case, referring to the zeroth characters of the alphabet as the minimum encoding values<br>
check13: memory copy incremented by one, from sierra to sierra_prime<br>
check14: dynamically insert yankee at index iota for pointer sierra, overwriting the next address<br>
check15: inserting yankee at index iota for pointer sierra, redefining the addresses of the pointer to avoid an overwrite<br>
check.tree: compares the sizes of a pointer to a struct with a mostly unallocated pointer of a sub-struct with a struct that initializes the sub-struct<br>
